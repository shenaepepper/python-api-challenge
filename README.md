# python-api-challenge
my codes are located in WeatherPy-checkpoint.ipynb and VacationPy-checkpint.ipynb in the vacationPy I had trouble with my outputs I couldn't figure it out. 
In part 1 WeatherPy there was a requirement to explain what the linear regression is modelling. Describe any relationships that you notice and any other findings you may uncover. I put this on each of the plots on the outputs so the discussion for that is in the code. Thank you
